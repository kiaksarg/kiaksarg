## Head Rotation Amplification in VR (Unity)

I developed and implemented a **head rotation amplification (gain)** system in **Unity** for VR applications. This system adjusts and amplifies the user's head rotation using various gain techniques to enhance immersion and improve interaction in virtual environments.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- Implemented multiple gain strategies:
  - **Dynamic Non-linear Gain**
  - **Velocity-Guided Gain**
  - **Controller-Based Gain**

- Integrated several application methods:
  - **Direct Delta**
  - **Cubic Spline Interpolation**
  - **Pre-calculated Gains**
