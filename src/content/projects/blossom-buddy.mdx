<div className="mb-4">
I developed Blossom-Buddy as a group project for the Prototyping Interaction course at Umeå University in Autumn 2023.
</div>

<div className="mb-4">
  One core activity in the HCI discipline is the design of new and novel interactive computing systems in the form of prototypes. Such prototypes are created to bring a design idea to life, allowing for exploration, evaluation, improvement, and communication of the concept. In this essay, I reflect on the process of designing Blossom-Buddy (Figure 1) as a novel interactive computing system.

## Blossom-Buddy Concept

<div className="mb-4">
  Blossom-Buddy addresses common struggles with habit-building and behavior change by tapping into our innate desire to care for living things. 
  To maintain your plant's health, you must first complete your tasks. The system comprises:
</div>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-6">
  <li>Water and nutrient dispensers</li>
  <li>Full-spectrum grow lights</li>
  <li>An interactive digital screen displaying a virtual plant</li>
</ul>

<div className="mb-8">
  Completing tasks—such as exercising, meditating, socializing, or reducing phone use—earns resources that keep your plant healthy and thriving.
</div>

## Prototyping Process

<div className="mb-4">Throughout the Blossom-Buddy project, prototypes played a crucial role in developing and refining the design:</div>

### Early Prototypes
<p className="mb-4">Used primarily for ideation and communication, these prototypes clarified basic functionalities and guided the evolution of the initial concept.</p>

  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">Figure 2: Early ideation prototypes.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Vertical Prototypes
<div className="mb-4">These focused prototypes explored specific interactions in detail. We notably used React.js to prototype interactions quickly, assessing the usability of physical buttons and interface interactivity effectively.</div>

</figure>

### Integration Prototype
<div className="mb-4">This comprehensive prototype combined all aspects of Blossom-Buddy. Though partially simulated using a <em>"Wizard of Oz"</em> technique, it allowed for effective lab-based user evaluations.</div>

  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500">Figure 5: Figma interface, sad version.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Reflections

<div className="mb-4">Blossom-Buddy exemplifies Research through Design (RtD) by generating knowledge and raising new research questions about motivational technologies and behavior change. The prototypes acted not only as design tools but also as instruments for inquiry and discovery. They highlighted how personality differences influence user responses and opened questions about optimal friction in persuasive design. This project fostered my development of a <em>prototype mindset</em>, highlighting the power of simple, fast, and economical prototyping as critical in design exploration and research.</div>

## Future Directions

<div className="mb-4">Future iterations of Blossom-Buddy could:</div>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-6">
  <li>Integrate with smartphones and wearable devices for automatic task tracking</li>
  <li>Further explore the balance of friction in behavior-change technology</li>
  <li>Conduct field studies with fully functional prototypes to gain deeper insights into long-term behavioral impacts</li>
